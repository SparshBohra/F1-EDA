# F1-EDA
Formula 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

Seems like the data for number of races won by each driver is erroneous and not dated since Michael Schumacher is no longer the record holder for most number of races won and has 91 grand prix wins as opposed to what is in the dataset.

The notebook is large and may not load on github. 

Use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SparshBohra/F1-EDA/blob/master/F1-EDA.ipynb.

The 2 datasets have been taken from kaggle:
1) https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/code?datasetId=468218&sortBy=voteCount
2) https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017/code?datasetId=5571&sortBy=voteCount
